### Remaining Tasks and Refactoring

1. Career component
2. Document component
3. Unit test
4. e2e test
5. Refactor code according to standard like naming etc, clean up code.
6. Refactor and reconsider:
  - vueuse
  - composable 
7. Refactor and improve UI
  - Currently use plain CSS
  - Clean up CSS code
  - Try other figma plugins to extract CSS / vue code. Only used Locofy free plugin. 
  - Use Vuetify or Tailwind UI?

### Improvement Plan

1. Implement proper authentication. Options like: JWT, Auth0, Firebase etc. 

2. Revise and improve coding strategy

- Unable to follow best practices directly as it's my first time using vue and I'm not totally proficient with typescript.
- Strategy used: 
    - Plan and design the architecture
    - Start coding with basic knowledge and idea of best practices (after skimming through documentation). 
    - Clean up once the features all working.
- Limited time to commit on planning and coding.
