### Refactoring or Improvement Plan

1. Improve UI
- Currently use plain CSS
- Clean up CSS code
- Try other figma plugins to extract CSS / vue code. Only used Locofy free plugin. 
- Use Vuetify or Tailwind UI

2. Improve authentication. Options like: JWT, Auth0, Firebase etc. 

3. Standardize, clean up code according to best practices.

4. 

### Self improvement (to ask for advice)

- Unable to follow best practices directly as it's my first time using vue and I'm not totally proficient with typescript.
- Strategy: code first with basic knowledge and basic idea of best practices (after skimming through documentation). 
- Limited time to commit on planning and coding.
